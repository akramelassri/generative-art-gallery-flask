# Interactive Generative Art Gallery

**Subject :** Design and implement an interactive art  
gallery using Python, where users can  
explore generative art, interact with creative  
visualizations, and manipulate images or audio in  
artistic ways.

## Concepts and Design of the gallery

**Concepts of the gallery:**

The gallery comprises a collection of applications, including:

• Drawing App  
• Audio Processing App  
• Image Manipulation App  
• Data visualization App

Users can navigate to each app, each offering unique features that enable the  
creation of beautiful and creative artworks, which can be saved to the gallery as  
desired.

### Drawing App Features:

The drawing app has features where the user can draw shapes,rotate  
them,change color and resize them, move them and delete them

the most interesting feature was the drawing functions implemented to generate  
beautiful mathematical shapes circular patterns rosecurves patterns and  
spirograph patterns

### Data Visualization App Concept:

The concept of the Data visualization app was interesting , a user could upload  
a data set of his choice, choose cleaning options, choose his desired columns  
and the app would show what available plot can he generate

• The image manipulation app’s features were applying effects to a photo to  
generate beautiful effects

• The audio procesing app’s features were also applying effects but to  
audios the interesting one was mixing audios in my opinion

• lastly the style transfer app using a machine learning model to apply the  
style of another photo to the desired photo

• For the design of the app, we tought to use a simple yet elegant design  
that enables ease of use and subsenquently ease of mind while using the  
app

### Image Manipulation App Features:

Apply effects to photos to create stunning visual results.

### Audio Processing App Features:

Apply effects to audio files. The app offers an audio mixing feature, which is  
fun to play around with.

### Design of the gallery:

For the design of the app, we tought to use a simple yet elegant design that  
enables ease of use and subsenquently ease of mind while using the app

## Techniques and tools used:

**Backend:**

• Python

**Frontend:**

• HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Web Framework:**

• Flask: The web framework for the gallery

### Drawing Application:

• Pygame: enabling drawing shapes with event handling for dynamic  
manipulation 

• pygame-gui: An extension of Pygame that provides a simple GUI  
framework, enabling the creation of interactive elements like buttons and  
menus within the drawing app.

• Shapely: A library for the manipulation and analysis of planar geometric  
objects; employed to perform geometric calculations and manage shape  
properties.

### Data Visualization Application:

• Matplotlib: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and  
interactive visualizations in Python.

• Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level  
interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

• Wordcloud: A tool for generating word clouds from text data, useful for  
visualizing the most frequent terms in a dataset.

• Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library; used for data  
cleaning, transformation, and preparation prior to visualization.

### Image Manipulation Application:

• OpenCV : for audio manipulation

### Audio Processing Application:

• pydub: A simple and easy-to-use library for audio manipulation; used for  
tasks like applying effects and mixing audio tracks.

## Challenges:

The first challenge was:

Initially, we aimed to develop a full-fledged desktop application using Pygame  
and pygame-gui, implementing a state machine pattern to switch between  
different app states(pages). This approach required significant time and effort,  
leading to large code (which is still available on GitHub but ultimately unused). 

Due to time constraints, we pivoted to developing a web-based application  
using Flask, while retaining the drawing app portion from the desktop version.

The second challenge was:

The lack of prior experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

So We had to quickly learn and apply these technologies to create an engaging  
user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).

Fortunately AI tools were useful to implement such features without hours  
spent in searching the web

## Conclusion

This project was an interesting opportunity to delve into the world of pygame  
and create dynamic apps and also web programming, it was also interesting to  
think about artistic ways to implement this gallery, thank you professor for this  
valuable experience.
